\f3  Can't join channels that require a key with the GUI. A workaround is to use this command "/join #room password" for the room.\

\f2 \'b7
\f3  SOCKS and HTTP proxies don't function still.\

\f2 \'b7
\f3  Window grouping preferences switched to the Interface preferences. You will need to redo your groupings using the new rule based system.\

\f3\fs24  
\fs20 Colloquy now requires 10.3.9 or 10.4. We now use the libxml and libxslt libraries that come with only these systems. Colloquy's application size has been reduced since we no longer bundle libxml and libxslt frameworks.
\f1\b\fs28 \

\f2\b0\fs20 \'b7
\f3\fs24  
\fs20 Improved built-in tab completion to be quicker and more intuitive. Typing tab will enter nickname completion mode. Any characters typed after tab will keep looking for matches. Hitting the space key while you have a ambiguous prefix will accept the current nickname and jump to the end of the selection.
\f1\b\fs28 \

\f2\b0\fs20 \'b7
\f3\fs24  
\fs20 Improved nickname completion when using the system word complete. We will now append a space or a colin and space if the nickname is at the beginning of the line. Additional words no longer show up in the list, only nicknames. To get a complete list (nicknames and words) use the F5 key.
\f1\b\fs28 \

\f2\b0\fs20 \'b7
\f3\fs24

\f3\fs24  
\fs20 Updated to the latest Irssi code base (revision 3756).
\f1\b\fs28 \

\f2\b0\fs20 \'b7
\f3\fs24  
\fs20 Fixed a few memory leaks that mainly occurred if Smart Transcripts were being used.
\f1\b\fs28 \

\f2\b0\fs20 \'b7
\f3\fs24  
\fs20 Colloquy again works while logged in with Hebrew or Arabic as the default language under Mac OS 10.4.
\f1\b\fs28 \

\f2\b0\fs20 \'b7
\f3\fs24  
\fs20 Colloquy's performance is no longer adversely affected by keeping Connection Consoles open.
\f1\b\fs28 \

\f2\b0\fs20 \'b7
\f3\fs24  
\fs20 Added a new file transfer preference to let Colloquy know how to handle a transfer if the file already exists. This allows auto resume, auto overwrite, auto cancel and ask with a dialog. Thanks Thomas Chen for the code submission.
\f1\b\fs28 \

\f2\b0\fs20 \'b7
\f3\fs24  
\fs20 Changed the DCC send packet size from 512 to 4096 (the largest possible, and usually the most efficient). This greatly improves transfer speeds.\

\f2 \'b7
\f3  Colloquy will now correctly remember what rooms were joined when the computer sleeps. You will no longer be joined to rooms that you have had closed prior to sleeping.\

\f2 \'b7
\f3  If you simply type /topic in a room we will request the current topic, this is handy if you connect with a proxy that doesn't forward the current topic.\

\f2 \'b7
\f3  We now send an identify message to NickServ before any auto-joins or commands (if the nickname password is stored for the connection.)\

\f2 \'b7
\f3  The bundled Growl framework is now 0.7, please update your Growl preference pane to take full advantage of new features.\

\f2 \'b7
\f3  New rule based Interface preferences panel. Colloquy defaults to a single window interface with Smart Transcripts grouping in another window. Previous grouping preferences from the Behavior panel wont carry over to the new rule system. You will need to make new rules to restore any desired behaviors.\

\f2 \'b7
\f3  We now remember drawer size, open state and use small icons on a per-window basis. Windows are identified by the windows you define in the new Interface preferences. New windows that aren't defined there share the same preferences.\

\f2 \'b7
\f3  The /part (and /leave) command now accepts a reason. Note that this means that a room list given may not include spaces; previously, you could do 
\f4\fs18 \cf4 \CocoaLigature0 /part #foobar, #barfoo
\f3\fs20 \cf0 \CocoaLigature1  but this is no longer valid. Use 
\f4\fs18 \cf4 \CocoaLigature0 /part #foobar,#barfoo
\f3\fs20 \cf0 \CocoaLigature1  to do this.\

\f2 \'b7
\f3  Added Command-Option-Q to quit immediately without a confirm dialog.\

\f2 \'b7
\f3  New preferences to always show the tab bar and what side to open the window drawer.\

\f2 \'b7
\f3  New preferences to show full room names. This will show any IRC room prefixes in the interface.\

\f2 \'b7
\f3  New preferences to strip incoming colors and/or formatting.\

\f2 \'b7
\f3  New preference to retain any input box colors and formatting between sent messages.\

\fs20 Customizing a variant in the appearance preferences will again show you a live preview. All chats using that Style/Variant combination will need reloaded (/reload style) to show the changes.
\f1\b\fs28 \

\f2\b0\fs20 \'b7
\f3\fs24

\f2\b0\fs20 \'b7
\f3\fs24

\fs20 Rewrite of most of the legacy code. This brings better integration of SILC and other nice features.\

\f2 \'b7
\f3\fs24  
\fs20 Kicks that you perform on another user can have colors and text formatting, and will use the room's encoding now.\

\f2 \'b7
\f3\fs24  
\fs20 Improved scrollbar highlight marking and the ability to jump from highlighted messages with Commnad-[ and Command-].\

\f2 \'b7
\f3\fs24  
\fs20 Added F-Script support if you have the F-Script installed. Colloquy will load any plugins with the .fscript file extension. More info is available on the Colloquy developers page. This adds the command /fscript console, and /fscript load <file path> (edit, unload and reload work also).\

\f2 \'b7
\f3  IRC notices can now be styled differently.\

\f2 \'b7

\f2 \'b7
\f3\fs24  
\fs20 New custom version of the regular expression framework, based on the latest PCRE 5.0. This allows the usage of \\p for unicode properties.\

\fs20 Browsing rooms is significantly more processor efficient, with filtering being greatly improved for large networks like Quakenet.\

\f2 \'b7
\f3\fs24  
\fs20 Holding down the Shift key during launch will prevent auto-connects. Holding down Shift while connecting to a server will prevent auto-join rooms. Holding down Command while connecting will prevent auto-commands. Holding both, prevents both.\

\f3\fs20 \cf0 \CocoaLigature1 . The -p flag will keep the ignore rule permantly until deleted, the -m flag is to specify a message ignore, the -n flag is to specify a nickname ignore. Nickname ignore is the default, so 
\f5\i /ignore moron 
\f3\i0 would ignore that person in all rooms and private chats on this server. This 
\f5\i /ignore -mn /moron.*/ /is listening \\w*/ #adium #colloquy
\f3\i0  would ignore users that start with "moron" and use the /itunes script in the Colloquy or Adium chat room. Ignore requires custom styles to support it first before messages are hidden.
