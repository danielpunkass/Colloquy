	* (AIM/TOC) Support PAUSE/SIGNON
	   - I have no real way to test this
	   - Will cause an extra FC_DOINIT and FC_CONNECTED on the SIGNON

	   - Not sure if this was the problem

	* Data sending is done non-blocking; kernel buffer fill is a fatal error
	* Change socklen_t's to unsigned int's (seems to be a GNUism)
	* Timeouts are set for name resolution and protocol signon; neither should take more than 5 seconds
	   - This takes care to save your SIGALRM handler, but it won't function during the name resolution or handshake code
